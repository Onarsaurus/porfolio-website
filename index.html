                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    As a developer I'm particularly interested in web development, unrestricted to front-end or
                    back-end.
                    I love many different UI/UX designs across the web and how they vary from site to site in both
                    visuals and practicality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy a plethora of other things such as nature, philosophy, and a number of my hobbies.
                    I'll always love learning new things! A common free time activity of mine is playing video games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated South East Community College in 2025 and obtained my Associates of Applied Science in
                    Computer Information Technology - Application Development.

                    <h4> My process </h4>

                    <p> Before any code was written I used Lucid Charts to create class diagrams and database structure
                        diagrams (UML). Once I had enough to work with and a solid vision I began creating the classes I
                        needed and the front end, creating the main pages I would need for basic functionality like
                        logging
                        in and logging out. With that, I also needed a database and used my diagram to create it and
                        work
                        with. Generally, I tried to avoid css and thematic design, as I wanted to focus on the core
                        functionality. My development for this project has unfortunately been a little all over the
                        place,
                        jumping from feature to feature, but I began with figuring out how to go about the calendar.
                        Eventually I decided to use Calendar.js. From then on I wanted to work with lists. It was
                        difficult
                        to figure out the database side of working with lists but eventually I was able to get to an ok
                        spot
                        with the feature. Then I worked on a simple profile page where you could change your username
                        and
                        password. Throughout this whole process, I have asked the people around me what ideas they have
                        and
                        if they thought I could do something better, which has been a big help during the process.
                    </p>

                    <h4>What I learned</h4>

                    <p> I've learned a lot from this project, but to keep it short here are the main things I've learned
                        (or
                        learned more about) worth noting: database storage, servlets, JavaScript and back end
                        communication,
                        CSS, UX.</p>


                    <h4>Continued Development</h4>


                    <p> I would like to continue finalizing the calendar and, well, most every feature can be improved
                        and
                        finalized. I look forward to creating a cleaner UI/UX and will work to create truly the perfect
                        one
                        solves all task managment website. I would also like to implement cleaner and more efficient
                        code
                        overall. Once I've finalized features and optimized code I'll look to publish the website and
                        personally make use of it.</p>

                <p>
                    A web application GUI for interacting with a physical “cannon” that uses a queue of commands to
                    execute

                    <h4>Overview</h4>

                    <img class="projectScreenshot" src="images/PCBThumbnail.png"
                        alt="A screen shot of the Project Cannonball application">

                    <p> Project Cannon ball describes a project in which the user uses a web GUI to interact with a
                        physical
                        cannon (arduino, servos, motors, etc). The user has access to commands and a queue which will be
                        used to make the cannon move or fire. It should be noted this cannon is probably not what you
                        are
                        picturing. The user can can also create custom commands and these commands will be saved for
                        later
                        (Custom commands are just a preset queue of commands, you cannot technically create a new action
                        for
                        the cannon). Project Cannonball was the final project for my PC Capstone class.</p>

                    <h4>Unfortunately</h4>

                    <p>I don't have access to the physical cannon used by this project, however the code can still be
                        analyized and inspected to see the intention.</p>

                    <p>I learned a lot about JSON and JSON formatting, and sending this data to the server and working
                        with
                        the data. I also learned a little about the python server integration (the queue).</p>
